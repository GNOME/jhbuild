"JHBuild is a tool designed to ease building collections of source "
"packages, called “modules”. JHBuild uses “module set” files to describe "
"the modules available to build. The “module set” files include dependency"
" information that allows JHBuild to discover what modules need to be "
"built and in what order."

"JHBuild was originally written for building `GNOME "
"<http://www.gnome.org>`__, but has since been extended to be usable with "
"other projects. A “module set” file can be hosted on a web server, "
"allowing for build rules independent of the JHBuild project."

"JHBuild can build modules from a variety of sources, including `CVS "
"<http://www.cvshome.org/>`__, `Subversion "
"<http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__, `Bazaar <http://www.bazaar-"
"vcs.org/>`__, `Darcs <http://darcs.net/>`__, `Git <http://git.or.cz/>`__ "
"and `Mercurial <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>`__ repositories, as "
"well as Tar and Zip archives hosted on web or FTP sites. JHBuild can "
"build modules using a variety of build systems, including Autotools, "
"CMake, Meson, WAF, Python Distutils and Perl Makefiles."

"JHBuild is not intended as a replacement for the distribution's package "
"management system. Instead, it makes it easy to build software into a "
"separate install prefix without interfering with the rest of the system."
