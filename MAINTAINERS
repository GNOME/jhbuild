Frederic or James should review and modify/update/trim this file.  I'm just
committing something so I can update the external dependencies for 2.20.

  - Only really involved with the modulesets, particularly the official gnome
    ones (I have provided patches for other parts of jhbuild, but not very many).
    I'm not even sure I belong in this list, but I'm just throwing something
    together so I can commit an update to the gnome moduleset.
